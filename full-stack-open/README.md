# Full Stack Open

This repository contains my progress of the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

From the course website:  

*Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.*
