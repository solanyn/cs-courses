# Conditionals

* Conditional Steps
    * Check something that make a decision depending on the condition
* Comparison Operator
    * Boolean expressions using comparison operators evaluate to True / False or Yes / No
    * Comparison operators look at variables but do not change the variables

* Indentation
    * Increase indent after an if statement or for statement (after :)
    * Maintain indent to indicate scope
    * Blank lines are ignored - they do not affect indentation
    * Reduce indentation back to the level of the if statement or for statement to indicate the end of the block

* Mixing tabs and spaces will result on indentation errors even if everything looks fine

* Two-way Decisions with else
    * if-else statements
    * One or two the branches will run but in no case will both of the branches run

* Multi-way
    * elif statements
    * Run one and skip the other two, only runs one path until condition is satisfied
    * Order matters
    * Can have no else statement

* Multi-way Puzzles
    * Careful with expressions, only runs until it sees Falses, does not look further ahead

* Try / Except Structure
    * Surround a dangerous section of code with try and except
    * If the code in the try works - the except is skipped
    * If the code in the try fails - it jumps to the except section
    * If errors occur outside the try-exception structure, execution stops
    * Doesn't come back to the code if exception occurs
    * Careful with usage for this reason
