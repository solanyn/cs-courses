# Strings
* String Data Type
    * A string is a sequence of characters
    * A string literal uses quotes 'Hello' or "Hello"
    * For strings, + means "concatenate"
    * When a string contains numbers, it is still a string
    * We can convert numbers in a string into a number using `int()`

* Reading and Converting
    * We prefer to read data in using strings and then parse and convert the data as we need
    * This gives us more control over error situations and/or bad user input
    * Raw input numbers must be converted from strings

* Looking inside strings
    * WE can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in square brackets
    * The index value must be an integer and starts at zero
    * The index value can be an expression that is computed

* A character too far
    * You will get a Python error if you attempt to index beyond the end of a string
    * So be careful when constructing index values and slices

* Strings have length
    * The built-in function `len` gives us a length of a string
