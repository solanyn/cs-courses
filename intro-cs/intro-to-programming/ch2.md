# Chapter 2 - Variables, Expressions and Statements

* Constants
    * Fixed values are called constants

* Reserved Words
    * Cannot use reserved words as variable names / identifiers

* Variables
    * Choose names of variables
    * Change the contents of a variable in a later statement

* Python Variable Name Rules
    * Must start with a letter or underscore _
    * Must consist of letters, numbers and underscores
    * Case Sensitive

* Mnemonic Variable Names
    * Since we are given a choice in how we choose our variable names, there is a bit of 'best practive'
    * Name variables to help us remember what we intend to store in them (memory aid)
    * Can be confusing since well-named variables often sound so good that they must be keywords

* Sentences or Lines
    * Assignment statements
        * Assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement
    * Expression statements
        * Numeric Expressions
            * Addition + 
            * Subtraction -
            * Multiplication *
            * Division /
            * Power **
            * Remainder %
        * Order of Evaluation
            * Parenthesis
            * Power
            * Multiplication
            * Addition
            * Left to right
    * What does "Type" Mean?
        * In Python variables, literals, and constants have a "type"
    * Type Matters
        * Some operations are prohibited
        * Python knows what "type"
        * You cannot "add 1" to a string
        * Can ask Python what type something is by using the `type()` function
    * Several Types of Numbers
        * Float
        * Integer
    * Type conversions
        * Integer will be implicitly converted to float in an expression with a float and integer
        * Can control this with built in functions `int()` and `float()`
    * Integer Division
        * Integer division produces a floating point result
    * String Conversions
        * Convert from string to float or int
        * Error is string does not contain numeric characters
    * User Input
        * We can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user using the input() function
        * The input() function returns a string
    * Converting User Input
        * If we want to read a number from the user, we must convert it from a string to a number using a type conversion function
    * Comments in Python
        * Anything after a `#` is ignored by Python
        * Why comment?
            * Describe what is going to happen in a sequence of code
            * Document who wrote the code or other ancilliary information
            * Turn off a line of code - perhaps temporarily
