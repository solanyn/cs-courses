# Using Web Services

## Data on the Web
* With the HTTP Request/Response well understood and well supported, there was a natural move toward exchanging data between programs using these protocols
* We needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between applications and across networks
* There are two commonly used formats: XML and JSON

## Sending Data across the "Net"
* So many programs, all different langauges
* How do we send standardised protocol for data?
* "Wire protocol" - what we send on the "wire"

## Agreeing on a "Wire Format"
* XML
* JSON

## XML
* Marking up data to send across the network

## eXtensible Markup Language
* Primary purpose is to help information systems share structured data
* It started as a simplified subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and is designed to be relatively human-legible

## XML Terminology
* Tags indicate the beginning and ending of elements
* Attributes - Keyword/value pairs on the opening tag of XML
* Serialize / De-Serialize - Convert data in one program into a common format that can be stored and/or transmitted between systems in a programming language-independent manner

## XML Basics
* Start tag <person> 
    * name whatever you want
* End tag
* Text content
* Attribute
* Self closing tag

## Whitespace
* Line ends do not matter
* White space is generall discarded on text elements
* We indent only to be readable
    * Sent compacted

## XML "Elements" (or Nodes)
* Simple element
    * Contains data
* Complex element
    * Includes child tags

## XML as a Tree
* Can be thought of as a tree

## XML as Paths
* Can be thought of paths
* Coming up with ways to walk through and parse XML data

## XML Schema
* Describing a "contract" as to what is acceptable XML
* Description of the legal format of an XML document
* Expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents
* Often used to specify a "contract" between systems - "My system will only XML that conforms to this particular Scheme."
* If a particular piece of XML meets the specification of the Schema - it is said to "validate"

## XSD XML Schema (W3C spec)
* We will focus on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) version
* It is often called "W3C" because "Schema" is considered generic
* More commonly it is called XSD because the file names end in .xsd

## XSD Structure
* xs:element
* xs:sequence
* xs:complexType

## JavaScript Object Notation
* Douglas Crockford - "Discovered" JSON
* Object literal notation in JavaScript
* JSON represents data as nested "lists" and "dictionaries"

## Service Oriented Approach
* Most non-trivial web applications use services
* They use services from other applications
    * Credit Card Charge
    * Hotel Reservation systems
* Services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make use of the service (API)

## Multiple Systems
* Initially - two systems cooperate and split the problem 
* As the data/service becomes useful - multiple applications want to use the information / application

# Web Services

## Application Program Interface
The API itself is largely abstract in that it specifies an interface and controls the behaviour of the objects specified in that interface. The softwarte that provides the functionality described by an API is said to be an "implementation" of the API. An API is typically defined in terms of the programming language used to build an application.

## API Security and Rate Limiting
* The compute resources to run these APIs are not "free"
* The data provided by these APIs is usually valuable
* The data providers might limit the number of requests per day, demand an API "key", or even charge for usage
* They might change the rules as things progress...
