Tracking my coursework recommended by the OSSU computer science pathway

As of 23/1/2021 when I start the OSSU pathway, I have already completed a Master of Data Science and Bachelor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (Computer Engineering major) degrees.

At this time I feel that a more well-rounded CS education would benefit me the most which is why I decided to start this course.
