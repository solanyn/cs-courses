# Relational Databases and SQLite

## Random access
* When you can randomly access data..
* How can you layout data to be most efficient?
* Sorting might not be the best idea

## Relational databases
Relational databases model data by storing rows and columns in tables. The power of the relational database lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables and in particular where there are multiples and the relationships between those tables involved in the query.  

## Terminology
* Database - contains many tables 
* Relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes
* Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an "object" like a person or a music track
* Attribute (also column or field) - one of possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row

## SQL
* Structured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the database
    * Create a table
    * Retrieve some data
    * Insert data
    * Delete data

## Web Applications w/ Databases
* Application Developer - Builds the logic for the application, the look and feel of the application - monitors the application for problems
* Database Administrator - Monitors and adjusts the database as the program runs in production
* Often both people participate in the building of the "Data model"

## Database Administrator
A database administrator (DBA) is a person responsible for the design, implemenetation, maintenance, and repair of an organisation's database. The role includes the development and design of database strategies, monitoring and improving database performance and capacity, and planning for future expansion requirements. They may also plan, coordinate, and implement security measures to safeguard the database.

## Database Model
* A database model or database schema is the structure or format of a database, described in a formal language supported by the database management system. In other words, a "database model" is  the application of a data model when used in conjunction with a database management system.

## Common Database Systems
* Three major Database Management Systems in wide use
    * Oracle - Large, commercial, enterprise-scale, very very tweakable
    * MySQL - Simpler but very fast and scalable - commercial open source
    * SQLServer - Very nice - from Microsoft (also Access)
* Many other smaller projects, free and open source
    * HSQL, SQLite, Postgres, MariaDB

## SQLite Browser
* SQLite is a very popular database - it is a free and fast and small
* SQLite Browser allows us to directly manipulate SQLite files
* SQLite is embedded in Python and a number of other languages

## Let's make a database!

## SQL: Insert
* The insert statement inserts a row into a table

```SQL
INSERT INTO Users (name, email) VALUES ('Kristin', 'kf@umich.edu')
```

## SQL: Delete
* Deletes a row in a table based on a selection criteria

```SQL
DELETE FROM Users WHERE email='ted@umich.edu'
```

## SQL: Update
* Allows the updating of a field with a where clause

```SQL
UPDATE Users SET name='Charles' WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
```

## Retrieving Records: Select
* The select statement retrieves a group of records - you can either retrieve all the records or a subset of the records with a WHERE clause

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Users

SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='csev@umich.edu'
```

## Sorting with ORDER BY
* You can add an ORDER BY clause to SELECT statements to get the results sorted in ascending or descending order

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY email

SELECT * FROM Users ORDER BY name DESC
```

## This is not too exciting (so far)
* Tables pretty much look like big fast programmable spreadsheets with rows, columns, and commands
* The power comes when we have more than one table and we can exploit the relationships between the tables

## Complex Data Models and Relationships
* Next lesson

## Database Design
* Database design in an art form of its own with particular skills and experience
* Our goal is to avoid the really bad mistakes and design clean and easily understood databases
* Others may performance tune things later
* Database design starts with a picture...

## Building a data model
* Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
* Basic Rule: Don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead
* When there is one thing in the "real world" there should be one copy of that thing in the database

## For each "piece of info"
* Is the column an object or an attribute of another object?
* Once we define objects, we need to define the relationships between objects

## Representing Relationships in a Database
* Foreign keys

## Relational Power
* By removing the replicated data and replacing data and replacing it with references to a single copy of each but of data we build a "web" of information that the relational database can read through very quickly - even for very large amounts of data
* Often when you want some data it comes from a number of tables linked by these foreign keys

## The JOIN Operation 
* The JOIN operation links across several tables as part of a select operation
* You must tell the JOIN how to use the keys that make the connection between the tables using an ON clause

## Many-to-many to Relationships
* Sometimes we need to model a relationship that is many-to-many
* We need to add a "connection" table with two foreign keys
* There is usually no seperate primary key

## Complexity enables speed
* Complexity makes speed possible and allows you to get very fast results as the data size grows
* By normalising the data and linking it with integer keys, the overall amount of data which the relational database must scan is far lower than if the data were simply flattened out
* It might seem like a tradeoff - spend some time designing your database os it continues to be fast when your application is a success

## Additional SQL Topics 
* Indexes improve access performance for things like string fields
* Constraints on data - (cannot be NULL, etc..)
* Transactions - allow SQL operations to be grouped and done as a unit

## Summary
* Relational databases allow us to scale to very large amounts of data
* The key is to have one copy of any data element and use relations and joins to link the data to multiple
* This greatly reduces the amount of data which must be scanned when doing complex operations across large amounts of data
* Database and SQL design is a bit of an art form
