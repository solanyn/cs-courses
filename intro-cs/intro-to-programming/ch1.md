# Chapter 1 - Why Program?

* Computers want to be helpful
    * Built for one purpose - to do some things for us
    * Need to speak their language to describe what we want done

* Programmers Ancticipate Needs
    * iPhone applications are a market
    
* Users vs. Programmers
    * Users see computers as a set of tools - word processor, spreadsheet etc

* Why be a programmer?
    * To get some task done
        * We start with this
    * To produce something for others to use - job
        * Add guestbook to a website
        * Needs a little more training

* What is Code? Software? A Program?
    * A sequence of stored instructions
        * It is a little piece of our intelligence in the computer
        * We figure something out then we encode it and then give it to someone else to save them the time and energy of figuring it out
    * A piece of creative art - particularly when we do a good job on user experience

* Programs for Humans
    * Macarena
        * Effectively a set of instructions
    * Humans are good at correcting errors
        * Computers are not and are extremely literal
    * We have to be really precise in our instructions
        * Computers can't compenensate when we make small mistakes
        
* Programs for Python
    * Counting the most frequent word in a sentence
    * Can't easily solve the problem as human

* Hardware Architecture
    * Why hardware architecture?
        * Understand what our resources are
    * Definitions
        * CPU
            * Central Processing Unit
            * Asks many times per seconds, what do you want me to do next?
            * Through the pins, we feed it instructions
            * We can't talk to it directly, so we store it in the RAM
            * Not that smart, but very very fast
        * RAM
            * Random Access Memory
            * Where our instructions are stored
                * We write the instructions
            * Instructions disappear when power is off
            * Temporary storage
            * **We are here**
        * Secondary Storage
            * Permanent storage
            * Files, applications and things live here

* Python as a Language
    * Early Learner: Syntax Errors
        * Need to learn Python language so we can communicate our instructions to Python.
    * What do we say?
        * Elements of Python
            * Vocabulary / Words - Variables and Reserved words
            * Sentence structure - valid syntax patterns
            * Story structure - constructing a program for a purpose

        * Interactive vs. Script
            * Interactive - type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds
            * Script - Enter a sequence of statements into a file using a text editor and tell Python to execute the statements in the file

        * Program Steps or Program Flow
            * Program is a sequence of steps to be done in order
            * Steps can be conditional (can be skipped)
            * Sometimes steps or groups of steps is to be repeated
            * Sometimes store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program

        * Conditional 
            * If statements
        * Repeated
            * Iteration statements
