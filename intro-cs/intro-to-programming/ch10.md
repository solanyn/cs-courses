# Tuples

## Tuples are like lists
* Tuples are another kind of sequence that funcitons much like a list - they have elements which are indexed starting at 0
* List functions work the same way as list - max, min

## but... Tuples are "immutable"
* Unlike a list, once you create a tuple, you cannot alter its contents - similar to a string

## Things not to do with tuples
* `x.sort()`
* `x.append()`
* `x.reverse()`

## A tale of two sequences
* `dir(list())`
    * Many list manipulation methods
* `dir(tuple())`
    * None, only count and index

## Tuples are more efficient
* Since Python does not have to build tuple structures to be modifiable, they are simpler and more efficient in terms of memory use and performance than lists
* So in our program when we are making "temporary variables" we prefer tuples over lists

## Tuples and assignment
* We can also put a tuple on the left-hand side of an assignment statement
* We can even omit the parenthesis
* `a, b = (1, 2)`

## Tuples and Dictionaries
* The `items()` method in dictionaries returns a list of (key, value) tuples

## Tuples are comparable
* The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences. If the first item is equal, Python goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds elements that differ.
