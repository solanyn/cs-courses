# Regular Expressions

## Regular Expressions
In computing, a regular expression, also referred to as "regex" or "regexp", provides a consise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.

Really clever "wild card" expressions for matching and parsing strings

## Understanding Regular Expressions
* Very powerful and quite cryptic
* Fun once you understand them
* Regular expressions are a language unto themselves
* A langauge of "marker characters" - programming with characters
* It is kind of an "old school" language - compact

## The Regular Expression Module
* Before you can use regular expressions in your program, you must import the library using `import re`
* You can use `re.search()` to see if a string matches a regular expression, similar to using the `find()` method of strings
* You can use `re.findall()` to extract portions of a string that match your regular expression, similar to a combination of `find()` and slicing: `var[5:10]`

## Using re.search() like find()
```Python
# Using find()
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    if line.find('From: ') >= 0:
        print(line)

# Using re.search()
import re

hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('From: ', line):
        print(line)
```

## Using re.search() like startswith()
```Python
# Using startswith()
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From: '):
        print(line)

# Using re.search()
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From: ', line):
        print(line)
```

We fine-tune what is matched by adding special characters to the string

## Wild-card characters
* The dot character matches any character
* If you add the asterisk character, the character is "any number of times"

```
X-Sieve: CME Sieve 2.3
X-DSPAM-Result: Innocent
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
X-Content-Type-Message-Body: text/plain
```

`^X.*:` yields the above. 

- `^` matches the start of the line
- `.` matches any character
- `*` many times (of the previous modifier)

Yields find lines that start with `X` followed by any character, many times followed by `:`

## Fine-tuning your match
* Depending on how "clean" your data is and the purpose of your application, you may want to narrow your match down a bit

`X-\S+:` yields: find all lines that start with `X-` followed any non-whitespace character one or more times followed by `:`

## String parsing examples
```Python
>>> data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
>>> atpos = data.find('@')
print(atpos)
21
>>> sppos = data.find(' ', atpos)
print(sppos)
31
>>> host = data[atpos+1:sppos]
>>> print(host)
uct.ac.za
```

Extracting a host name - using find and string slicing

## The double split pattern
Sometimes we split a line one way, and then grab one of the pieces of the line and split that piece again

```Python
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008

words.line.split() # stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
email = words[1] # ['stephen.marquard', 'uct.ac.za']
pieces = email.split('@') # 'uct.ac.za'
print(pieces[1])
```

## Regex version

```Python
import re
line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('@([^ ]*)', line)
print(y)

['uct.ac.za']

```

`@(c[^ ]*)` yields find all expressions that start with `@` and following that character match any number of non-blank characters 

## Even cooler regex version
```
import re
line = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008'
y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)', line)
print(y)
```

## Escape character
* If you want a special regular expression character to just behave normally (most of the time) you just prefix it with `\`

```Python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies.'
>>> y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+', x)
>>> print(y)
['$10.00']
```

`\$[0-9.]+`
- `\$` A real dollar sign
- `[0-9.]` A digit or period
- `+` At least one or more (need this because it needs to extend to the following numbers)

## Summary
* Regular expressions are a cryptic but powerful language for matching strings and extracting elements from those strings
* Regular expressions have special characters that indicate intent
